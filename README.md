# Apriori

Hello,

This is a new project for Machine Learning Algorithms.I handled a dataset to make analysis with Apriori which is a Unsupervised 
Machine Learning Algoritms.I perform Market Basket Analysis with a random dataset which can be found at Kaggle.
Apriori is easy to implement,easy to understand but a little bit slow algorithm so we can deliver a solution for 
our dataset and we can obtain association rules.

This goes like ;

C1 - L1 , C2 - L2 , C3 -L3 and we finally get rules for our data.
We specified the parameters in the program such as confidence interval,min - max item etc.
